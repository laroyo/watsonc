STEP 1: Carefully read the SENTENCE below and select all the RELATION TYPE(s) that you think are expressed between the TWO HIGHLIGHTED WORDS in the text.  Note that if one of the WORDS appears multiple time you will have to consider only the highlighted one.

STEP 2a: Select the words from the text that support or indicate that the selected RELATION TYPE holds. 

         Example 1:  
         for the relation 'PREVENTS' between 'INFLUENZA' and 'VITAMIN C' 
         in the sentence ".... the risk of influenza is reduced by vitamin C..."
         paste here the words: "reduced by"

         Example 2: 
         for the relation 'DIAGNOSE' between 'RINNE TEST' and 'HEARING LOSS' 
         in the sentence " ... RINNE test is used for determining hearing loss ..."
         paste here the words: "used for determining"

STEP 2b: If you select 'NONE' in STEP 1, then explain why do you think there is no relationship between the two words in the sentence.

NOTE: You are not expected to have a domain knowledge in the topic of the text. It doesn't matter if you don't know what the highlighted words mean. It is important to understand what the different relation types mean (in STEP 1). HOVER MOUSE over each relation name to see the DEFINITION and an EXAMPLE.
