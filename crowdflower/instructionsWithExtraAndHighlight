STEP 1: Read the SENTENCE below and select all the RELATION TYPE(s) that you think are expressed between the TWO HIGHLIGHTED WORDS in the text.  

Note that if one of the WORDS appears multiple time you will have to consider only the highlighted one.

STEP 2a: Highlight the words from the text that support or indicate that the selected RELATION TYPE holds in this sentece. 

         Example 1:  
         for the relation 'PREVENTS' between 'INFLUENZA' and 'VITAMIN C' 
         in the sentence ".... the risk of influenza is reduced by vitamin C..."
         highlight the words: "reduced by"

         Example 2: 
         for the relation 'DIAGNOSE' between 'RINNE TEST' and 'HEARING LOSS' 
         in the sentence " ... RINNE test is used for determining hearing loss ..."
         highlight the words: "used for determining"

How to HIGHLIGHT words in the TEXT:
- click on each word in the text that you want to SELECT
- click on already highlighted word to DE-SELECT it

NOTE: You can inspect your current selection in the text field below.

STEP 2b: If you select 'NONE' in STEP 1, then explain why do you think there is no relationship between the two words in the sentence.

NOTE: You are not expected to have a domain knowledge in the topic of the sentence. It doesn't matter if you don't know what the highlighted words mean. It is important to understand what the different relation types mean (in STEP 1). HOVER MOUSE over each relation name to see the DEFINITION and an EXAMPLE.
